# CogniLoop AI

**CogniLoop AI** is an AI-powered learning assistant that focuses on *real understanding*, not just answers.

Instead of moving learners forward after content consumption, CogniLoop detects confusion, diagnoses the root cause, and validates mastery through teach-back before progressing.

## Problem

Most learning tools:
- Fix surface-level mistakes
- Forget past learning struggles
- Assume understanding without verification

This creates **hidden knowledge gaps** that compound over time.

---

## Solution

CogniLoop AI uses a **closed-loop learning system**:

1. Detect when a learner is stuck  
2. Diagnose the exact conceptual gap  
3. Track gaps persistently across sessions  
4. Validate understanding via teach-back  

Learning only progresses once understanding is proven.
